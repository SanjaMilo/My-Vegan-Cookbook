# MERN project

### This is a Cookbook of simple vegan recipes, a website where you can find good recipes, search for a recipe, create your own recipe and make a list of saved recipes.

To create a new recipe or make a list of favorite recipes, you will need to create a user (sign up) and log in. All recipes are public and do not require authentication.

#### This project is my personal learning venture and dive into full stack development.

For this project I've used:

- React.js
- Material UI
- Redux toolkit
- Express Node.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas
- Images from website: https://www.freepik.com/images
- For hosting I will use some free options
